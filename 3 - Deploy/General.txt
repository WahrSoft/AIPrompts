 I need to create an Enterprise grade Bicep solution for Azure deployment using best practices
 - create a Key Vault to put secrets in that are found in appSettings
 - If the app uses SQL, use a SQL connection string that uses a configured managed identity for the web app service
 - Use the current user account for the Entra Admin for SQL.  
 - Configure a virtual network and use private endpoints to talk to all dependent services. 
 - Seperate the bicep files by resource having it all brought together in main.bicep
 - Write the files out directly to an infra folder on the root
 - For AppService, ensure the startup command is set

Then create GitHub Actions to build just selected solution. ensure the infrastructure is deployed, and deploy application to the new infrastructure.

Include any instructions needed to setup access to Azure.
